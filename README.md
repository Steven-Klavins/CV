I'm a full-stack developer, musician, and artist in pursuit of a career where I can share my love of tech and nurture my creativity. Just a few short months ago I took a huge risk and left the stability of my job to pursue my passion.

Following my resignation, I taught myself OPP principles, attended Makers academy, and immersed myself in new tech. It was an amazing experience working alongside other developers, I grew exponentially.

## Skills

#### A methodical learner
Every project I worked on provided something new to learn and developing an effective learning process became something rather important to me. I found Team knowledge sharing, breaking down larger problems into smaller achievable goals, and self-led learning to work best. When overcoming a new challenge I also found it helpful to reinforce my knowledge through blogging, you can find examples of these blogs [here.](https://medium.com/@stevenklavins94)

#### An agile worker and XP proponent
Stating "I am an agile worker" is a fairly ambiguous statement, however stating I adhere to the XP values (feedback, simplicity, communication, courage, and respect) provides a little more substance. These values contributed to a large portion of the success my teams at Makers had. Ensuring everyone felt valued within our team produced positive morale and the motivation to overcome challenges. A number of my colleagues have stated I have a calm yet focused approach when working in a team.

#### A meticulous promblem solver
Arguably one of the most important things a developer can be is an effective problem solver, not only in the context of tech but everyday soft skills too. Throughout my career, I have demonstrated an exceptional ability to problem solve under pressure. Just some examples of this include dealing with hostile customers in a calm and constructive manner, finding team consensus on how specific tech problems should be tackled, and sharing solutions to common problems others may also have. Just a few days prior to writing this CV I helped two of my colleagues retrieve hundreds of code contributions by sharing a solution I found when experiencing the same problem.
